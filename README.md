## 📄 Creating the YAML File
Before running the application, create a file named **`students.yaml`** and structure it as follows:

```yaml
students:
  - name: Alice
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.8
  - name: Bob
    age: 22
    major: Mathematics
    gpa: 3.5
  - name: Charlie
    age: 20
    major: Physics
    gpa: 3.9
  - name: David
    age: 23
    major: Chemistry
    gpa: 3.2
  - name: Eva
    age: 21
    major: Computer Science
    gpa: 3.7
```

## 🏗️ Running the Application
1️⃣ Ensure `students.yaml` and `app.py` are in the same directory.
2️⃣ Run the script using:
```sh
python app.py
```

3️⃣ Follow the on-screen instructions to filter students by GPA.

## 🖥️ Expected Output
Upon running the script, you should see output similar to:
```
All Students:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Bob, Age: 22, Major: Mathematics, GPA: 3.5
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: David, Age: 23, Major: Chemistry, GPA: 3.2
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7

Enter minimum GPA to filter students: 3.6
Students with GPA >= 3.6:
Name: Alice, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.8
Name: Charlie, Age: 20, Major: Physics, GPA: 3.9
Name: Eva, Age: 21, Major: Computer Science, GPA: 3.7
```

## 🎯 Customization Options
🔹 Modify `students.yaml` to add or remove student details.
🔹 Extend `app.py` to include sorting features.
🔹 Implement CRUD operations to manage students dynamically.
